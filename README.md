This website is a system which uses Philips Hue lights to give a suggestion as to a healthy time to eat after a meal.
The light is initially green and over time will fade to red as it reaches the user's set time for their next meal.
through out the fade the user can press reset or partial reset based on how much they eat to put the timer back and increase the time again until it turns red.
this data will be saved in a local storage array and will be used for statistics that the user can see.
